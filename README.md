# GoCad
A simple cad program written in golang

For now 2D but hopefully 3D in the future
## Features
- Idk a few things
## Todo:
- Reorganize Files into cad package and main package ties it all together
- Rename some methods in cad package so not everything implements the base one
- Render IDs to framebuffer for selections to work
- write the constraint solver
  - write tests for the constraint solver
- add icons to the object tree
- general styling to make it more CAD-like
